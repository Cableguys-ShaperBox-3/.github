## 🧠 Overview

**Cableguys ShaperBox 3** is an advanced effects toolbox that combines multiple modulation-based processors into a single, flexible environment. It allows producers to shape volume, filters, width, distortion, time, and more using precise, drawable curves synced perfectly to the project tempo.

The modular design lets users stack and combine different Shapers, creating complex rhythmic patterns and evolving effects with ease. Visual envelopes and real-time feedback make it simple to understand how each movement affects the sound, encouraging experimentation and fast creative decisions.

Built for Windows-based music production, ShaperBox 3 integrates seamlessly with modern digital audio workstations. Its optimized engine ensures smooth performance, making it suitable for both sound design exploration and practical mixing workflows.
